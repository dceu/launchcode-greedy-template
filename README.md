# Launchode Greedy

This is a fork from mpmenne's template for the Greedy assignment in launchcode-java-class/pset5.

For this assignment, the Greedy class takes an argument of a dollar amount, and computes the least amount of coins needed to evaluate the passed dollar amount.

Test cases are provided as JUnit tests, which are to be expanded upon.

I developed my own algorithm to handle the passed arguments for the Greedy class, and changed the output string to be an array of coin types and counts for each coin.
